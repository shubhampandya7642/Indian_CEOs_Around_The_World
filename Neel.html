        <div class="margin"><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><hr noshade></div>

        <p>Neal Mohan was born in 1973 in Lafayette, Indiana into a Hindu family of Indian Tamil origin. He grew up in the U.S state of Michigan, as well as in Florida, before briefly spending a few more years in India during high school at St. Francis' College. At some point between then and the 1990s, Mohan moved back to the United States. He attended Stanford University, graduating in 1996 with a degree in electrical engineering.</p>

        <div class="margin"><hr noshade><h2>Career</h2><hr noshade></div>

        <div class="margin"><h3>Accenture and NetGravity</h3></div>

        <div><p>After graduation, Mohan worked at Accenture, then owned by Arthur Andersen. In 1997, he joined a startup called NetGravity, becoming a key figure in the company's operations and greatly expanding its prominence.</p></div>

        <div class="margin"><h3>DoubleClick</h3></div>

        <div><p>In 1997, NetGravity was acquired by DoubleClick. Mohan moved from California to the company's headquarters in New York. In the next several years, he gradually became more involved in central business affairs within the company, with DoubleClick relying on him for cutting costs in the wake of the burst of the dot-com bubble. He became the vice president of business operations.</p></div>

        <div class="margin"><h3>Google</h3></div>

        <div><p>On April 13, 2007, Google agreed to acquire DoubleClick for US$3.1 billion. Google executive Susan Wojcicki largely orchestrated this action. For the next 15 years, she worked extensively with Mohan, who formally joined Google in 2007, playing a key role in the integration process with DoubleClick. While at Google, Mohan managed the company's 2010 US$85 million acquisition of Invite Media. Before moving to YouTube, he was senior vice president of display and video ads at Google.</p></div>

        <div class="margin"><hr noshade><h2>YouTube</h2><hr noshade></div>

        <div><p>Mohan joined YouTube in 2015 as Chief Product Officer. During his time at the company, he managed a number of its marquees throughout the late 2010s and early 2020s, including YouTube Music, YouTube TV, YouTube Premium, YouTube Shorts, and YouTube NFTs.</p></div>

        <div><p>Following September 2020, Mohan appeared before Congress and participated in a White House summit, during which he introduced a new content moderation policy for YouTube aimed at addressing violent extremist content on the platform. This policy expanded upon previous ones targeting groups such as ISIS, by prohibiting content that glorified violence or sought to recruit or fundraise for extremist organizations, regardless of whether the content was directly associated with a designated terrorist group.</p></div>

        <div><p>Concurrently, YouTube initiated a media literacy campaign to assist viewers, particularly younger ones, in recognizing manipulation techniques employed in the dissemination of misinformation.</p></div>

        <div class="margin"><hr noshade><h2>CEO</h2><hr noshade></div>

        <div><p>DoubleClick was acquired by Google in 2007, an acquisition largely oriented by Google executive Susan Wojcicki. She and Mohan extensively worked together for the next fifteen years. In 2015, Mohan became CPO of YouTube, which Wojcicki headed as CEO. Upon Wojcicki's resignation on 16 February 2023, he succeeded her as CEO of YouTube.</p></div>
